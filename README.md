# Lab1
In the given text, it is required to hide a certain phrase consisting of letters. We split the hidden text into bits. If the next bit of the secret message is equal to one, then double the space in the container text. If the next bit of the hidden text is equal to zero, then the space remains alone. Plain letters are skipped in the container text. That is, in order to hide the word "text" (4 letters, 4 bytes or 32 bits), you need a text container with at least 32 spaces.
